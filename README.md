This is a repository created for collaboration on midterm project at Data Analysis bootcamp by Iron Hack.

We are working on "Olist" online retailers data set.
The goal is to make BI research on the data and present our findings.

The pipeline:

We are using SQL for queries and Tableau for visualisation and presentation.
Due to prohibitive aggregation time from Tableau, for most of our charts the data is aggregated in MySQl desktop and exported to ".csv" files, then we use them in Tableau. 

The files.

There are few separate ".sql" files with saved queries in the root of the project. Files with data are in Data Sources folder.
The main Tableau file with presentation is Tableau/SA/DrillDown.twb
Tableau/SA/Dataincluded contains data used internally by Tableau.
Stack Overflow is a folder that contains a candidate for the project that we decided not to run with for the current project.
